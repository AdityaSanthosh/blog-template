title: Demystifying python's typing.Annotated
---

FastAPI heavily uses this advanced Python typing feature (Python 3.9+).

The Problem Annotated Solves: Standard Python type hints (param: str) are primarily for static analysis and are ignored at runtime. However, sometimes you need to attach more information (metadata) to a type hint that a library can read and act upon at runtime.

How Annotated Works: It allows you to "annotate" a type with arbitrary metadata: Annotated\[Type, metadata1, metadata2, ...]. Python itself ignores the metadata, but frameworks can read it.

Annotated In FastAPI's Context: Annotated provides a clean, standardized, and explicit way to combine a parameter's type with instructions for FastAPI.

Before Annotated (or without it): The Query(...) object acts as both a default value and FastAPI's instruction. This can be ambiguous.\
\

```python
from fastapi import Query

# Is Query() a default value or a special instruction?
# It's a bit ambiguous.
q: str = Query(min_length=3, description="Search query string")
```

\
With Annotated (The clearer way): The parameter's type (str) is separated from the instruction (Query(...)) for FastAPI.\

```python
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import Query

# Clear: 'q' is a string. The Query(...) part is *metadata*
# telling FastAPI how to handle it (source from query, validate length, add description).
q: Annotated[str, Query(min_length=3, description="Search query string")]
```

\
Another common use case: Pydantic Models (v2+): When defining data models, Annotated with Field provides a clear distinction between validation and serialization metadata.\

```python
from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class User(BaseModel):
    # 'name' is a string. The Field(...) is metadata for Pydantic validation.
    name: Annotated[str, Field(min_length=2, max_length=50)]
    age: Annotated[int, Field(gt=0, le=120)]
```

\
Conclusion: Annotated makes your code more readable and explicit by neatly separating the variable's type from its source/validation/behavioral instructions. It's a powerful feature that libraries leverage to provide intuitive APIs.

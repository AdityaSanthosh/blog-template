<h4>
	Let's say a thread delegated a task to another thread. (Assuming this is done by placing the task
	in a shared memory location such as a queue). How does the background thread notify the primary
	thread once the task is completed/failed?
</h4>

The background thread can notify the primary thread using several common methods:

1.  <u>**Shared Memory with Synchronization:**</u> The threads use shared data (e.g., status flags) protected
    by synchronization mechanisms like **mutexes**, **condition variables**, or **semaphores**. The background
    thread updates the shared status and signals the primary thread, which was waiting for this signal.
2.  <u>**Callbacks:**</u> The primary thread passes a function reference to the background thread. The
    background thread invokes this function upon completion/failure.
3.  <u>**Futures/Promises/Tasks:**</u> Higher-level abstractions where the primary thread receives a
    `Future` object immediately. The background thread sets the result/exception on this `Future`, which
    the primary thread can then `get()` or attach callbacks to.
4.  <u>**Message Queues:**</u> The background thread places a result/status message on a queue that the
    primary thread monitors.
5.  <u>**Event Systems:**</u> Threads publish events (e.g., "TaskCompleted") that other threads subscribe
    to.

---

<h4>Wait, what are the differences between mutexes and condition variables again</h4>

- <u>**Mutexes**</u> (`threading.Lock` in Python) ensure only one thread accesses the shared data at
  a time.
- <u>**Condition Variables**</u> are used with mutexes to allow threads to efficiently wait for a specific
  condition (e.g., task completion) without constantly polling. The background thread signals the condition
  variable when the state changes.
- <u>**Semaphores**</u> are counting mechanisms that can be used for simple signaling (a count of 0 means
  "wait," releasing increments the count, potentially waking a waiting thread).

<h4>
	On a high level, can I say that if the primary thread doesn't want to blocked waiting for the
	completion of background thread task, it has to have a event loop to check the status of the task
</h4>

Yes, on a high level, if the primary thread needs to remain unblocked while waiting for a background task, it generally requires a **non-blocking mechanism** for notification. An **event loop** is a powerful pattern to achieve this. Instead of blocking, the primary thread continues its work and either:

- **Periodically polls** for status (less efficient).
- **Receives callbacks** (often managed by a higher-level event system or thread pool) that are dispatched to its context.
- Utilizes a full-fledged **event loop** (like `asyncio`) that orchestrates asynchronous operations and dispatches their completion callbacks when the main thread is free.

---

<h4>
	Well how can a callback triggered by background thread run in main thread context if main thread
	is doing something. It has to put that in a completion queue I guess
</h4>

You are absolutely correct. A callback triggered by a background thread cannot directly execute in the primary (main) thread's context if the main thread is busy. To achieve this, it relies on an **intermediary mechanism, often a message queue or event queue (your "completion queue").**

- The background thread **places an "event" or "message"** (containing the callback and its arguments) onto a thread-safe queue.
- The primary thread, as part of its own **event loop**, periodically checks this queue.
- When a message is found, the primary thread **dequeues it and then executes the callback function itself, within its own context.**
  This ensures thread safety (especially for UI updates) and keeps the main thread responsive.

---

<h4>So, technically even a callback is also a completion queue underneath</h4>

Yes, you are very accurate. In scenarios where a callback needs to run in a _different_ thread's context (like a background thread notifying the main/UI thread), **that callback is indeed queued underneath** by an underlying mechanism. The background thread doesn't directly call it, but rather puts a "request" for the main thread to execute the callback into a queue, which the main thread processes within its event loop.

<h4>Is this how things work in JS land with async/await, callbacks and promises?</h4>

Yes, this is exactly how it works in JavaScript. JavaScript is **single-threaded**, so it achieves concurrency through an **Event Loop** and **queues**, not through true parallelism with multiple CPU cores.

- <u>**Delegation:**</u> When `setTimeout` or `Workspace` are called, JavaScript **delegates** these
  long-running tasks to **Host APIs** (browser Web APIs or Node.js C++ APIs), which run in the background.
- <u>**Queuing:**</u> Once the Host API completes its task, it places the associated **callback function**
  (or Promise `.then()` handler, or `async/await` continuation) into either the **Microtask Queue** (for
  Promises/async/await, higher priority) or the **Macrotask Queue** (for `setTimeout`, I/O).
- <u>**Event Loop:**</u> The single JavaScript **Event Loop** continuously checks if the **Call Stack**
  (where synchronous JS runs) is empty. If it is, it first drains the entire **Microtask Queue**, and
  _then_ picks one task from the **Macrotask Queue** to push onto the Call Stack for execution. This
  ensures non-blocking behavior.

<h4>
	If js in single thread, how can async functions like `setTimeout` and api requests are executed.
	simple technical explainations please(no analogies)
</h4>

JavaScript has a single **Call Stack** for code execution. Asynchronous operations are handled by:

1.  <u>**Delegation to Host Environments:**</u> When `setTimeout` or `Workspace` are called, the JavaScript
    engine delegates these tasks to **Host APIs** (browser Web APIs or Node.js C++ APIs). These APIs
    are implemented in lower-level languages (like C++) and can perform operations concurrently _outside_
    the JavaScript engine. The JS function immediately returns.
2.  <u>**Background Execution:**</u> The Host API performs the task (e.g., timer countdown, network request)
    in the background.
3.  <u>**Completion & Enqueueing:**</u> Upon completion, the Host API places the associated **JavaScript
    callback function** into either the **Microtask Queue** (for Promises, async/await) or the **Macrotask
    Queue** (for `setTimeout`, I/O).
4.  <u>**Event Loop:**</u> The **Event Loop** constantly monitors if the **Call Stack is empty**. If
    it is, it first drains the entire **Microtask Queue**, then picks one task from the **Macrotask Queue**,
    and moves it to the Call Stack for the JavaScript engine to execute. This ensures sequential execution
    on the single thread while maintaining non-blocking behavior.

---

<h4>So host apis have different javascript interpreter. is that what you are saying</h4>

No, that's incorrect. <u>**Host APIs do NOT have different JavaScript interpreters.**</u>

- The <u>**JavaScript Engine**</u> (e.g., V8) is the _only_ component that interprets and executes your JavaScript code. It has a single Call Stack.
- <u>**Host APIs**</u> (Web APIs in browsers, C++ APIs in Node.js) are functionalities written in _other
  languages_ (like C++) that operate _outside_ the JavaScript engine.
- When JavaScript calls an async Host API, it's a **delegation** of a task to that external C++ code. The C++ code performs its operation. Once done, it doesn't execute JavaScript; instead, it **queues** the relevant JavaScript callback function to be executed by the _same single JavaScript engine_ when the Event Loop determines the Call Stack is free.
  <u>
  	**Web APIs (like `setTimeout`, `Workspace`, DOM manipulation) in browsers, and core modules in
  	Node.js (like `fs`, `http`), are predominantly implemented in low-level languages such as C or
  	C++.**
  </u> This is done for:
- <u>**Performance:**</u> To execute these I/O-bound or computationally intensive tasks as fast as possible.
- <u>**Access to System Resources:**</u> To directly interact with the operating system for things like
  network sockets, file I/O, or hardware.
- <u>**Security and Stability:**</u> To abstract complex system-level operations behind a safe JavaScript
  API.

_When JavaScript calls `Workspace()`, the JS engine delegates the actual network request to this underlying C++ implementation. This C++ code runs in the background. Once it receives a response, it doesn't execute JavaScript. Instead, it places the associated JavaScript callback (e.g., the `.then()` handler) into the JavaScript runtime's queues. The JavaScript Event Loop then picks up that callback when the single JavaScript thread is free to execute it._

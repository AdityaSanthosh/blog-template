1. Game Theory\
   Despite hearing about this topic for some time, I accidentally upon this [Veritasium video](https://youtu.be/mScpHTIi-kM?si=tAWyL-Szk5uwbqVB 'Veritasium Video') just today, and I am thankful for watching it. I never expected Game theory to be part of our everyday life. But I was struck by the solution to this problem and philosophical nature of it. Seriously, watch it guys!!

title: 'Fedora and Me: A Beginnerâ€™s Tale'

One day, I got so fed up with windows that I decided to try linux. I mean, I have a huge custom built gaming PC and still windows is not at all snappy on it. Windows runs lot of unnecessary background services which are hard to disable. But I know linux is light weight. So, I went and searched for the most shiny thing in Linux land. After spending a lot of time on choosing the right distro, I landed on Fedora, thanks to its promise of cutting edge features with stability. And spoiler, my experience with it wasn't great. \

For starters, there are multiple editions of fedora you can pick from. I chose the KDE spin, burned it on to my drive and started the installation. Here comes the first hurdle, the default partition manager shipped by Fedora isn't intuitive. I could tell on my first use because this wasn't my first experience with Linux. I had used Ubuntu several years ago and I remember the partition manager(GParted) to be intuitive and simple.
